## Creating a Virtual Environment and Installing Requirements for Blaze 🔥

To ensure a smooth and controlled development environment for Blaze, we'll walk you through the steps of creating a
virtual environment and installing the project's dependencies from the ```requirements.txt``` file.

* Navigate to your Blaze project directory using the cd
```cd /path-to-your/Blaze```

* Once inside your project directory, create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
    * On Windows: ```cd /path-to-your/Blaze```
    * On macOS and Linux: ```python3 -m venv venv```
  
* Now that you've created your virtual environment, you need to activate it:
    * On Windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate```
    * On macOS and Linux: ```source venv/bin/activate```

* With your virtual environment active, you can install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file:
    
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This command will go through the requirements.txt file and install each package, ensuring that your project has all the 
necessary dependencies. That's it! You've successfully set up a virtual environment for your Blaze project and installed 
its dependencies. You're now ready to dive into coding and making Blaze the hottest social media platform for your university! 🔥💻🚀 

## Running Blaze Locally 🔥

Now that you've set up the virtual environment and installed the necessary dependencies, let's run Blaze locally on your machine. Follow these steps:

* Make sure your virtual environment is still activated. If it's not activated, activate it using the appropriate command:
   - On Windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate```
   - On macOS and Linux: ```source venv/bin/activate```

* Navigate to your Blaze project directory if you're not already there:
    
    ```cd /path-to-your/Blaze``` 

* Run the development server: 
    
    ```python manage.py runserver```
  
This command starts the development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.

* Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

Blaze should now be accessible locally on your machine. Explore the features, create an account, and start sharing your university experiences!

## Additional Notes 🔍

- If you make changes to the code, make sure to restart the development server to apply the changes.

- Access the Django admin panel at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) to manage Blaze's data.

- Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:  ```deactivate```



That's it! You've successfully set up and run Blaze locally. Enjoy the blazing social experience! 🔥💬📸✨
